# rails-agro-project

A simple garden and plant tracking web application with RESTful routes.

UPDATE [07/25/2019]: Now using Rails + JavaScript to render Gardens Index, Plants, and Comments

## Getting Started

Clone the repository down to your local environment using `git clone <repo>`

In terminal, do a `bundle install` command to install dependencies.

```
$ bundle install
```

Create the database using 'rake db:migrate' command.

```
$ rake db:migrate
```

Start up the app with `rails s` command

```
$ rails s
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login in your browser.

Create a user by signing up either with email and password or omniauth through your GitHub account.

IMPORTANT: YOU MUST SIGN UP BEFORE SEEDING OTHERWISE THE DUMMY DATA WON'T SEED AND YOU WILL GET AN ERROR!

Once you've signed up, you can seed the dummy data with `rake db:seed` command.

```
$ rake db:seed
```

Seed data should now be displaying when you navigate to http://localhost:3000/user/1/gardens in your browser.

Enjoy! ðŸ™‚
